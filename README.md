# Length of Stay Prediction of New York Hospital Inpatient Discharge Data
The dataset I use here is a public dataset provided by [New York State Department of Health](https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Hospital-Inpatient-Discharges-SPARCS-De-Identified/82xm-y6g8).

Length of Stay is a clinical metric that measures the length of time elapsed between a patient's hospital admittance and discharge. It's an important indicator of the efficiency of hospital management. Here I am trying to predict New York Hospital Inpatient Discharges Data in 2015.
